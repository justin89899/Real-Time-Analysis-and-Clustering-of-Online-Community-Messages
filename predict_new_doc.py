#new_doc = "Good morning and welcome to Tech News Now, TheStreet's daily tech rundown.In todays edition, we re covering Mark Zuckerbergs review of Apples Vision Pro, Microsofts and OpenAIs announcement about how they are dealing with threats from malicious actors, a departure from Apple's design team, and Max is adding Dolby Vision for live sports.It was only a matter of time, truly. But Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg, like Elon Musk, Sam Altman, and countless other individuals, tried out Apple's Vision Pro and has some thoughts. The main takeaway from his remarks: I donâ€™t just think that [Metas Quest headset] is the better value. I think Q His review was filmed using passthrough on the Quest 3, showing off the ability to also place windows around him. Zuckerberg explained that Metas latest headset weighs a bit less than Apples and can be worn comfortably for longer. Additionally, it is easier to move in since it doesnt have a battery pack, and he believes hand controllers and tracking are better inputs."
